# Data-Structures-for-Big-Data-Analysis
Exploring insights of Yelp Reviews


Chose Yelp Review and Rating dataset from kaggle.com, put concepts of Data Struc-
tures and Big Data to use,  (Using C++ Language)

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for performing big data analytics using the C programming language and fundamental data structures on the Yelp dataset. The project aims to demonstrate the power and efficiency of C along with various data structures for analyzing and extracting valuable insights from large-scale datasets, specifically focusing on the Yelp dataset.


### Introduction
In this project, we leverage the capabilities of the C language and data structures to efficiently handle and process the Yelp dataset, which contains a vast amount of information about businesses, user reviews, and ratings. By implementing optimized algorithms and data manipulation techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and correlations within the Yelp data to derive valuable insights for businesses and users.


Analytics Highlights
Performed data cleaning to preprocess data, applied
Machine Learning Algorithms such as (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and
Kmeans Clustering) to obtain Competitive grouping of restaurants and Recommen-
dation system based on location, alternatives, and Yelp Rating.
Efficient implementation of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs to handle Yelp dataset
Algorithms for sorting, searching, and statistical analysis of Yelp data
Mining user reviews and ratings to identify popular businesses and trends
Recommendation algorithms for personalized business suggestions
